            Well I made it 1200 miles already, 
            and I passed through some interesting places on the way:
            <ul>
                <li>Walla Wall, WA</li>
                <li>Magic City, ID</li>
                <li>Bountiful, UT</li>
                <li>Last Chance, CO</li>
                <li>Why, AZ</li>
                <li>Truth and Consequences, NM</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>

            I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the read today:
            "Passing cars, When you can't see, May get you, A glimpse, Of eternity."
            I definitely won't be passing any cars. :P

            My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go.
            Because I'm on a Segway I wasn't able to bring a whole lotwith me:
            <ul>
                <li>cell phone</li>
                <li>iPod</li>
                <li>digital camera</li>
                <li>and a protein bar</li>
            </ul>
            Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said, "A journey of a thousand miles
            begins with one <strike>step</strike> Segway"
